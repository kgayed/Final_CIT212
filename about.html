<div  class="about">
    <p> Egypt is a modern nation in an ancient land. The Nile River runs like a ribbon through the length of the country. The Nile Valley was the birthplace of one of the world's earliest civilizations. Reminders of Egypt's glorious past dot the landscape. For example, the Great Pyramid at Giza was one of the wonders of the ancient world. It is the only one that has survived.</p>
    <p> Egypt has one of the longest histories of any nation. It came into being about 3200 B.C. King Menes (also called Narmer) united the cities of northern and southern Egypt under one government. During his time, the giant statue known as the Sphinx was built. It appears part human and part beast and has fascinated travelers for centuries.</p>
    <p> Life in Egyptian cities has been strongly influenced by modern European culture. There are broad, paved streets and well-tended parks. Major cities are linked to the national network of highways and railroads. Many government offices and the courts of justice are located in urban centers. Most secondary schools and all universities are in cities. Many cities, particularly Cairo, are overcrowded and housing is in short supply.</p>

        The sort of food which is typical in Egypt today has been subjected to numerous influences over the centuries; influences which are still noticeable today. In fact, learning about Egyptian cuisine and the countless different dishes there are, can be an absolute amazing journey in itself, and one which can give you additional insight into the history of this fascinating land.

        Greek; Syrian, Lebanese; Turkish, and Palestinian culinary influences are especially prevalent in the modern Egyptian diet, just as they have been for thousands of years already. Many visitors are also amazed at just how widespread British and French food is in Egypt, and the fact that many British and French dining traditions are still practiced by a lot of Egyptians to this day.
